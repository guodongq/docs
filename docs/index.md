This is bruce, come from a city called chizhou in Anhui province. The city is very famous for a buddhist mountain called [jiuhua][1], which has large number of buddhist temples and attracts a lot of tourists every year.

In July 2012, I graduated from [Anhui university][2] majoring in network engineering, and then started to work.

Over these years, I Joined some companies, such as [Longshine][3], [ZTE][4]. I have participated in and developed a lot of projects, and most of them were related to back-end. I have also worked with some programming languages, java, python, golang etc. Now I am in HP Shanghai as a senior back-end engineer, and helped to develop a PaaS platform called Horizon.

In February 2020, my daughter was born, she is a gift for me. In my spare time, I like to watch movies, and play games. Sometimes I enjoy cooking and having delicious food with my family.
